# The_Ancient_Ones
The first out of the 2 tower defence games i plan to make.
Note: Everything currently in here is just a placeholder, the real images will come later

So this is a large tower defence game were you the player play as a Vampire called the Caretaker and it's your job to look after a bunch of goofy vampires (Who act as your towers) as the humans attempt to invade your land.
As the Caretaker you decide to subdue the humans entirely, so prepare for a battle through the eons as you battle humans and many other surprising factions that you will discover on your journey for the continent.
